## Your Router Security Assessment Playbook

After my shocking discovery of critical vulnerabilities in my own router, I've created this comprehensive guide to help you assess yours. This isn't just theory - it's exactly what I did, with all the commands and explanations you need.

## Prerequisites & Safety First

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Only test devices you own! Testing someone else's network without permission is illegal.

What you'll need:
- Your own router (you must be the owner/admin)
- A Linux machine (I used Fedora)
- [Warp terminal](https://www.warp.dev/) (for AI assistance)
- Basic command line knowledge
- About 2-3 hours

## Phase 1: Project Setup

First, let's create an organized workspace:

```bash
# Create project structure
mkdir -p ~/router-assessment/{scans,captures,reports,scripts}
cd ~/router-assessment

# Start a documentation log
cat > assessment-log.md << 'EOF'
# Router Security Assessment Log
Date: $(date)
Router Model: [Your Router Model]
Purpose: Educational security assessment of owned device
EOF
```

## Phase 2: Initial Discovery

### Find Your Router's IP

```bash
# Get your router's IP address
ROUTER_IP=$(ip route | grep default | awk '{print $3}')
echo "Router IP: $ROUTER_IP"

# Test connectivity
ping -c 4 $ROUTER_IP | tee scans/ping-baseline.txt
```

### Quick Port Scan

```bash
# Initial TCP scan
sudo nmap -sS -T4 -oA scans/initial $ROUTER_IP

# Check common UDP services
sudo nmap -sU --top-ports 100 -oA scans/udp-top100 $ROUTER_IP
```

## Phase 3: Deep Scanning

This is where things get interesting:

```bash
# Service version detection
sudo nmap -sV -sC -T4 -oA scans/service-version $ROUTER_IP

# Vulnerability scanning (this found my critical issues!)
sudo nmap -sV --script "vuln,auth" -T4 -oA scans/vuln-scan $ROUTER_IP
```

**What to look for:**
- Old service versions (like dnsmasq < 2.83)
- Open ports that shouldn't be (telnet, SSH)
- Authentication vulnerabilities
- Known CVEs

## Phase 4: Web Interface Security

Create this Python script to test web security:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# Save as scripts/web-security-test.py

import requests
import sys
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", message="Unverified HTTPS request")

def test_router_security(router_ip):
    print(f"🎯 Testing router at {router_ip}")
    
    # Test HTTP to HTTPS redirect
    print("\n🔍 Testing HTTP to HTTPS redirect...")
    try:
        response = requests.get(f"http://{router_ip}", 
                               allow_redirects=False, timeout=5)
        if response.status_code in [301, 302]:
            if response.headers.get('Location', '').startswith('https://'):
                print("✅ GOOD: HTTP redirects to HTTPS")
            else:
                print("❌ BAD: No HTTPS redirect")
        else:
            print(f"❌ BAD: HTTP returns {response.status_code}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
    
    # Check security headers
    print("\n🛡️ Testing security headers...")
    try:
        response = requests.get(f"http://{router_ip}", timeout=5)
        headers = ['X-Frame-Options', 'X-Content-Type-Options', 
                  'Strict-Transport-Security', 'Content-Security-Policy']
        for header in headers:
            if header in response.headers:
                print(f"✅ {header}: {response.headers[header]}")
            else:
                print(f"❌ Missing {header}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    router_ip = sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) > 1 else "192.168.1.1"
    test_router_security(router_ip)
```

Run it:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/web-security-test.py
python3 scripts/web-security-test.py $ROUTER_IP
```

## Phase 5: Understanding CVEs

If you find vulnerabilities (like I did), research them:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# Save as scripts/cve-research.py

import json
from datetime import datetime

def research_cve(cve_id, description):
    print(f"\n🔴 {cve_id}")
    print(f"Description: {description}")
    print(f"Research at: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/{cve_id}")
    print("Check if patches are available for your router model")

# Example CVEs I found
critical_cves = {
    "CVE-2017-14491": "Remote Code Execution in dnsmasq",
    "CVE-2017-14492": "Heap buffer overflow in dnsmasq",
    "CVE-2017-14493": "Stack buffer overflow in dnsmasq"
}

print("🔍 CVE Research Tool")
print("=" * 50)
for cve, desc in critical_cves.items():
    research_cve(cve, desc)
```

## Phase 6: Generate Security Report

Create a comprehensive report:

```bash
cat > reports/security-assessment.md << 'EOF'
# Router Security Assessment Report

## Summary
- **Date**: $(date)
- **Router Model**: [Your Model]
- **Risk Level**: [CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

## Findings

### Critical Issues
[List any CVE-2017-14491 type findings]

### High Risk
[Authentication issues, missing security headers]

### Medium Risk
[Self-signed certificates, information disclosure]

### Low Risk
[Minor configuration issues]

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Check for firmware updates
2. Disable unnecessary services
3. Change default settings

### Short-term Actions
1. Research custom firmware
2. Implement network segmentation
3. Set up monitoring

### Long-term Actions
1. Regular security assessments
2. Consider router replacement
3. Implement defense in depth
EOF
```

## Understanding Your Results

### Service Versions Matter
- **dnsmasq 2.80**: 60+ vulnerabilities
- **OpenSSH < 8.0**: Multiple security issues
- **Old firmware**: Years of unpatched bugs

### Common Vulnerabilities Found
1. **Remote Code Execution**: Attackers can take control
2. **Authentication Bypass**: Login can be circumvented
3. **Information Disclosure**: Router leaks sensitive data
4. **Denial of Service**: Router can be crashed

### Risk Levels Explained
- **CRITICAL (9-10)**: Fix immediately, router is compromised
- **HIGH (7-8.9)**: Fix within days, serious risk
- **MEDIUM (4-6.9)**: Fix within weeks, moderate risk
- **LOW (0-3.9)**: Fix when convenient, minimal risk

## The Power of AI Assistance

Throughout this process, Warp's AI helped by:
- Explaining complex vulnerability reports
- Suggesting safe testing methods
- Providing context for findings
- Recommending fixes

Example AI interaction:
```
Me: "What does CVE-2017-14491 mean?"
AI: "This is a critical vulnerability in dnsmasq that allows 
remote code execution. An attacker can send a specially crafted 
DNS request that overflows a buffer, potentially giving them 
complete control of your router. It affects dnsmasq versions 
before 2.78. You should update immediately or disable the 
DNS service if not needed."
```

## Your Action Plan

### If You Found Critical Vulnerabilities:
1. **Today**: Apply firmware updates or disable vulnerable services
2. **This Week**: Implement workarounds and hardening
3. **This Month**: Consider router replacement if no fixes available

### If Your Router is Secure:
1. Document your configuration
2. Schedule regular assessments (quarterly)
3. Stay informed about new vulnerabilities

## Tools and Resources

### Essential Tools Used:
- **Nmap**: Port scanning and vulnerability detection
- **Python requests**: Web security testing
- **Warp terminal**: AI-assisted command execution

### Helpful Resources:
- [NVD Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/): CVE research
- [Router Security](https://routersecurity.org/): Best practices
- [Warp Notebooks](https://docs.warp.dev/features/notebooks): Reusable security playbooks

## Creating Your Security Notebook

Save this as a Warp notebook for future assessments:

```markdown
# Router Security Assessment Notebook

## Setup
\`\`\`bash
ROUTER_IP={{ROUTER_IP}}
mkdir -p ~/router-assessment-{{DATE}}/{scans,reports,scripts}
cd ~/router-assessment-{{DATE}}
\`\`\`

## Scanning
\`\`\`bash
# Quick scan
sudo nmap -sS -T4 $ROUTER_IP

# Deep scan
sudo nmap -sV --script vuln $ROUTER_IP
\`\`\`

## Analysis
\`\`\`bash
# Check for critical services
grep -E "(dnsmasq|telnet|ssh)" scans/*.nmap

# List all CVEs found
grep -oE "CVE-[0-9]{4}-[0-9]+" scans/*.nmap | sort -u
\`\`\`
```

## Conclusion

Security assessment isn't just for professionals anymore. With the right tools and AI assistance, anyone can understand and improve their network security. The key is to:

1. **Start simple**: Basic scans first
2. **Understand findings**: Let AI explain
3. **Take action**: Fix what you find
4. **Keep learning**: Security is ongoing

Remember: Finding vulnerabilities isn't failure - it's the first step to security.
