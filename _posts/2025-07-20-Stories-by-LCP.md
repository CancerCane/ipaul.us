   ## Starting from year 53


   
   It's been a very short ride. Many people view 53 years as a short life time. Then others view is a resounding "He' an old guy". As those rules apply I don't know exactly how to feel about my journey. I will say, I would do it all again in a completely different manner. Not to be confused with regret but I regret it 50 percent of my life. Yes you've read right. I realize the misconception of thoughts that you it's a misnomer to "regret" ones life, but when you've chosen the wrong path as often as I have you would be bound to recreate those bad decisions. So, regretably I wish I had those choices to make again. 

   What I have managed to do is to take a different approach. The last few chapters I may have left to write about my life will be taken very carefully. Every and I mean every decision will be either passed on or deliberated upon. This words I write are just for me, if for any reason anyone reads this account and gain anything from it I will be very sorry. I will not be responsible. I choose that advice for all. Please take these accounts as just that accounts and not to be misconstrued with advice. July 20th 2025 has begun with the highest of hopes that I can live my last days, months, or years at the peak of happiness and satisfaction.
