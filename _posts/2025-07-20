   It's been a very short ride. Many people view 53 years as a short life time. Then others view is a resounding "He' an old guy". As those rules apply I don't know exactly how to feel about my journey. I will say, I would do it all again in a completely different manner. Not to be confused with regret but I regret it 50 percent of my life. Yes you've read right.
