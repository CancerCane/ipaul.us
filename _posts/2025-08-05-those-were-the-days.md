## Learning Linux the Long Way

### Going viral

I was well into retirement when I circled back to a 13-year-old dream: learn Linux and the command line. Back then I was a quiet geek with zero resources—unless you count the New Orleans public library and a stack of books written in what felt like Martian. Page one jumped straight into algorithms and alien math. I tapped out in under an hour and told myself, “Guess I’m not built for this.”

Fast-forward a few decades. The internet is in my kitchen now, and the excuses are thinner. I started over—with patience I had to borrow, and curiosity I already owned. Today I’ve got solid, working knowledge of the Linux kernel ecosystem and the CLI. I know the terms, I can read the syntax, and I can make the machine do what I’m asking most days. I’m not looking for props; if anything, I wish I’d started this reboot sooner.

If you’re self-teaching, here’s my strongest advice: don’t waste years spinning your wheels. Use the modern tools. My #1 recommendation is Warp Terminal. I found it a couple years ago, and the last two years taught me more than the previous five combined. It’s a fast, friendly terminal with AI baked in—like having a patient mentor sitting in the prompt with you.

Why I’m writing: I’m documenting the journey—wins, face-plants, and the shortcuts I wish someone had handed me. I’m not here to impress you; I’m here to encourage the version of you that’s one helpful nudge away from momentum. If that’s you, welcome. Let’s figure this out—one command at a time.
