## Going viral

I was well into retirement when I decided to teach myself the Linus operating kernel and the commandline. Something I started 40 years ago. I was more of a silent geek but with no resources to even get started. To be fair there was the public library system of New Orleans which is not saying much. First of all without a tutor or someone who knew enough to guide me at the time was a lose lose situation. 

Grabbing any text on the subject of computing was a lesson on how cripple your hopes as soon as you crack the book into that foreign language. Almost all the text jumped straight into algorithms and the oddest looking math problems a 13 year old in that public school system. As you can probably guess I gave up within the first hour of reading the book. I learned quickly it was not something I was even capable of doing. 

Fast forward 35 years and so many changes and directions to turn. Of course with endless resources at my finger tips and in my own kitchen. I set on with a new found enthusiasm. Currently I have accomplished the rudementary knowlegde of the linux kernel and commandline. I have a solid grasp of the terminology and syntax of the language. I know if you are reading this you know exactly my stand point right now. Please don't give me any props because trust me I should be further than where I am considering its all from experimenting and self study which is still very difficult I have the IQ of a garden hose. I will offer advice to anyone who's attempting self-taught route. Do not waste the time spinning your wheels. You would gain so much by utilizing all the modern day tools to catch you faster. My very first suggestion will be an application called WARP Terminal. 

WARP Terminal is the absolute single must have if you're as new to the commandline as I was 7 years ago. I have only recently discovered it in the past 2 years. These past 2 years was markedly more learning and understanding than I could have even imagined. Now WARP has the power of AI baked right into your commandline interface. It's like having Linus E. with you as you learn. 

## Titles aside

I have recently began to write a blog as a way to share my knowledge and ideas. Most of all to account for my journey. Something I only thought of doing in passing because of my lack in patience and mental internal clock that has developed a loud ticking in my head. Which is a huge weakness because without patience you are bound to spin your wheels trying to figure out faster ways from point A to point B.
