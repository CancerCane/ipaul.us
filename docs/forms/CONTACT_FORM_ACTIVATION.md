# Contact Form Activation Checklist

This document outlines the necessary steps to activate and test the contact form for production use.

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. **Choose Your Deployment Platform**

The form is currently configured for **Netlify Forms**. Determine where you're hosting:

- [ ] **Netlify** → Continue with current setup (easiest)
- [ ] **GitHub Pages** → Switch to Formspree or Web3Forms
- [ ] **Cloudflare Pages** → Use Web3Forms or Cloudflare Workers
- [ ] **Self-hosted** → Implement serverless function

### 2. **For Netlify Deployment (Recommended)**

If using Netlify, complete these steps:

1. **Deploy the site to Netlify**
   ```bash
   # Push latest changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add enhanced contact form"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Configure Email Notifications**
   - Log into Netlify Dashboard
   - Navigate to: Site → Forms → Form notifications
   - Add email notification:
     - Email: `ipaul@ipaul.us` (or your preferred email)
     - Subject: `New Contact: {{project_type}} from {{firstname}} {{lastname}}`
     - Form: Select "contact"

3. **Test the Form**
   - Submit a test entry
   - Check email (including spam folder)
   - Verify data in Netlify Forms dashboard

### 3. **For GitHub Pages Deployment**

If using GitHub Pages:

1. **Sign up for Formspree**
   - Go to https://formspree.io
   - Create account with `ipaul@ipaul.us`
   - Create new form
   - Copy Form ID

2. **Update contact.md**
   - Replace form action:
     ```html
     <form action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
     ```
   - Remove `data-netlify="true"` attribute
   - Remove `data-netlify-honeypot` attribute

3. **Deploy and Test**

### 4. **Email Configuration Requirements**

Regardless of platform, you need:

- **Primary Contact Email**: `ipaul@ipaul.us`
- **Backup Email**: Consider adding a backup recipient
- **Auto-responder Email** (optional): Thank customers automatically

### 5. **DNS/Domain Setup (if needed)**

For custom email sending:

1. **SPF Record**:
   ```
   v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:sendgrid.net ~all
   ```

2. **DKIM**: Configure through your email service provider

3. **MX Records**: Ensure email can be received at `ipaul@ipaul.us`
